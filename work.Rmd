# College of Nurse of Ontario
As a Data Analyst at the College of Nurses of Ontario, my role involved analyzing nursing data and building [HTML reports](https://www.cno.org/en/what-is-cno/nursing-demographics/statistical-reports/). Additionally, I took on multiple requests from internal stakeholders to outside researchers which involved ensuring their proposal is acceptable as well as identifying the data required for their projects. Tools used include R and SQL.

# St. Michael's Hospital
In the Applied Health Research Centre at St. Michaelâ€™s Hospital, I worked closely with [Dr. Charles Keown-Stoneman](http://stmichaelshospitalresearch.ca/researchers/charles-keown-stoneman/), an Investigator/Biostatistician within the [TARGetKids!](https://www.targetkids.ca/about) research group. I was a practicum student taking on the responsibilities of a Statistician. As part of the TARGetKids! COVID-19 Study, we studied COVID-19 public health measure adherence amongst parents and children in the Greater Toronto Area. Methods include linear mixed effects regression, piecewise linear regression, bootstrapping, cross-validation, LASSO regularization.

# Export Development Canada
My responsibilities as a Business Intelligence Analyst at EDC included working in R (tidyverse, caret) to predict customer retention and conversion of EDC insurance products using logistic regression and random forest classifiers. Additionally, I created dashboards in PowerBI and Excel to provide succinct summaries of targets and results for key metrics such as retention rates for stakeholders. I also produced weekly reports which involve querying data and running SAS EG projects and process flows. 

# GlobalData
I worked at GlobalData Plc as a Medical Data Analyst, where majority of my time was spent working on a pricing tool that shows insightful pricing information about medical device brands on a global scale. The markets that are addressed in this project include cardio (e.g. aortic stent grafts) and neurovascular (e.g. flow diverters). Software used for this project include Python (pandas) and Excel (pivot tables, macros). In addition to my projects, I was also required to write press releases, which are linked below.

# University of Toronto
Prior to my industry positions, I worked as a Data Analyst at the University of Toronto Centre for Industrial Relations and Human Resources. The project I worked on involved analyzing data on wages in the agriculture and farming industry, led by [Dr. Greg Distelhorst](http://www.gregdistelhorst.com/). I also provided Statistical Consulting services for a management consulting firm to answer some questions they had regarding user data which they collected from their health improvement platform. Both positions required the use of R (dplry, tidyr, ggplot2) in RStudio.

# Rotman School of Management
I worked as a Research Assistant at the Rotman School of Management under the supervision of [Dr. Chris Liu](https://business.uoregon.edu/faculty/chris-liu) on projects about scientific publications and careers. I used Stata and Python (pandas, pybliometrics) for these projects.
