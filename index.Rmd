## Introduction
My name is [Kevin Dang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dang-kevin/) and I am a recent graduate of the Master of Science in Biostatistics program from the University of Toronto, Dalla Lana School of Public Health. I also hold a Bachelor's degree from the University of Toronto in Applied Statistics and a minor in Mathematics, conferred in Spring 2020. 

Currently, I am a Data Analyst at the College of Nurses of Ontario. I recently finished my biostatistics practicum at St. Michael's Hospital where I now also work as a part-time Statistician.
