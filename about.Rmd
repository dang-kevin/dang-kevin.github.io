# Introduction
I am an MSc Candidate at the University of Toronto, and a Teaching Assistant for graduate and undergraduate courses in data science and statistics. My hobbies include calisthenics, soccer, table tennis, piano, and video games. The sections below are a summary of my work history.    

# St. Michael's Hospital
In the Applied Health Research Centre at St. Michaelâ€™s Hospital, I am working closely with [Dr. Charles Keown-Stoneman](http://stmichaelshospitalresearch.ca/researchers/charles-keown-stoneman/), an Investigator/Biostatistician within the [TARGetKids!](https://www.targetkids.ca/about) research group. I am classified as a Research Visitor, and my unofficial title is Junior Biostatistician. My work is on the TARGetKids! COVID-19 Study, specifically studying COVID-19 public health measure adherence amongst parents & children in the Greater Toronto Area. Methods include linear mixed effects regression, piecewise linear regression, bootstrapping, cross-validation, LASSO regularization. These are my [slides](files/TARGetKids_Presentation-Dec-2-2021.pdf) for my initial project presentation.

# Export Development Canada
From June 2020 to December 2021, I worked at at Export Development Canada (EDC) as a Business Intelligence Analyst. My responsibilities include working in R (tidyverse, caret) to predict customer retention and conversion of EDC insurance products using logistic regression and random forest classifiers. Additionally, I created dashboards in PowerBI and Excel to provide succinct summaries of targets and results for key metrics such as retention rates for SVPs, VPs, and other leaders at EDC. I also produced weekly reports which involve querying data and running SAS EG projects and process flows. 

# GlobalData
I worked at GlobalData Plc as a Medical Data Analyst in their Toronto office from September 2020 to September 2021. Majority of my time was spent working on a pricing tool that shows insightful pricing information about medical device brands on a global scale. The markets that are addressed in this project include cardio (e.g. aortic stent grafts) and neurovascular (e.g. flow diverters). Software used for this project include Python (pandas) and Excel (pivot tables, macros). In addition to my projects, I was also required to write press releases, which are linked below.

# University of Toronto
Prior to my industry positions, I worked as a Data Analyst at the University of Toronto Centre for Industrial Relations and Human Resources. The project I worked on involved analyzing data on wages in the agriculture and farming industry, led by [Dr. Greg Distelhorst](http://www.gregdistelhorst.com/). I also provided Statistical Consulting services for a management consulting firm to answer some questions they had regarding user data which they collected from their health improvement platform. Both positions required the use of R (dplry, tidyr, ggplot2) in RStudio.

# Rotman School of Management
I worked as a Research Assistant at the Rotman School of Management under the supervision of [Dr. Chris Liu](https://business.uoregon.edu/faculty/chris-liu) on projects about scientific publications and careers. I used Stata and Python (pandas, pybliometrics) for these projects.
